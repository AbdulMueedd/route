"""
VRP Route Optimizer — Flask Backend
The Cary Company

Solves a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with:
  - Pickup and delivery stops (deliveries run first, then pickups)
  - Trailer-based capacity constraints (each trailer type has its own capacity and zone access)
  - Priority stops (high/urgent stops are penalized if visited late)
  - Zone restrictions (trailer type determines which zones it can access)
  - Real road distances and travel times via OSRM
  - OR-Tools for route optimization

Units: distances in miles, time in minutes, cargo measured in pallets.

    """
    Runs the OR-Tools VRP solver and returns optimized routes.

    HOW THE CAPACITY MODEL WORKS
    ─────────────────────────────
    We use TWO separate capacity dimensions rather than one combined load dimension.
    This correctly handles the delivery-first, pickup-second workflow:

      DeliveryLoad dimension
        Each delivery stop has a positive demand equal to the cargo being dropped off.
        The cumulative sum of deliveries on a route must not exceed trailer capacity.
        start_cumul_to_zero=True means it starts at 0 and grows as deliveries are assigned.
        OR-Tools enforces: sum(deliveries on route) ≤ capacity.

      PickupLoad dimension
        Each pickup stop has a positive demand equal to the cargo being collected.
        The cumulative sum of pickups on a route must not exceed trailer capacity.
        start_cumul_to_zero=True means it starts at 0 and grows as pickups are assigned.
        OR-Tools enforces: sum(pickups on route) ≤ capacity.

    Since deliveries and pickups are separated in time (deliveries always run first,
    enforced via time window constraints), the trailer space is fully reused:
      - Truck leaves depot loaded with delivery cargo  → at most `capacity` units
      - Truck unloads at delivery stops                → space frees up
      - Truck loads pickup cargo                       → at most `capacity` units
      - Truck returns to depot with pickup cargo

    HOW THE TIME MODEL WORKS
    ─────────────────────────
    A single Time dimension tracks when each truck arrives at each stop.
    service time at each stop is included in the transit callback so the solver
    accounts for unload/load time before moving to the next stop.

    Pickup stops are given a time window that starts no earlier than the minimum
    time to complete one delivery — this enforces delivery-before-pickup ordering.

    HOW ZONE RESTRICTIONS WORK
    ───────────────────────────
    For each stop, we check if the assigned trailer's allowed_zones includes
    that stop's zone type. If not, we call VehicleVar.RemoveValue(v) to hard-forbid
    that truck from visiting that node.

    HOW PRIORITY WORKS
    ───────────────────
    Priority 2 (high) and 3 (urgent) stops get a soft upper bound on their arrival time.
    If the solver visits them later than the soft deadline, it pays a penalty proportional
    to priority. This biases the solver toward visiting important stops early.

    Args:
        loc_names:    Location names, index 0 = depot
        loc_coords:   (lat, lon) tuples, same order as loc_names
        loc_demands:  Cargo units per stop (0 for depot)
        fleet:        List of {"trailer": type, "id": str}
        loc_svc:      Service time in minutes per stop
        loc_windows:  (earliest, latest) arrival time in minutes from start of day
        n_deliveries: How many stops (starting at index 1) are deliveries vs pickups
        stop_zones:   Zone type string per location
        priorities:   Priority level (1=normal, 2=high, 3=urgent) per location

    Returns:
        (result_dict, dist_matrix, time_matrix)
        result_dict is None if no solution was found.
